    "# 04. Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 1: Feature Extraction  迁移学习 -特征抽取\n",
    "\n",
    "We've built a bunch of convolutional neural networks from scratch and they all seem to be learning, however, there is still plenty of room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve our model(s), we could spend a while trying different configurations, adding more layers, changing the learning rate, adjusting the number of neurons per layer and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, doing this is very time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there's a technique we can use to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called **transfer learning**, in other words, taking the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and using them for our own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
    "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
    "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has **already learned** patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is, instead of hand-crafting our own neural network architectures or building them from scratch, we can utilise models which have worked for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "And instead of training our own models from scratch on our own datasets, we can take the patterns a model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them as the foundation of our own. Doing this often leads to getting great results with less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few notebooks, we'll see the power of transfer learning in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through the following with TensorFlow: 介绍迁移学习，小数据集验证，迁移学习抽取特征，tensorboard记录训练，tensorboard对比模型\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce transfer learning (a way to beat all of our old self-built models)\n",
    "- Using a smaller dataset to experiment faster (10% of training samples of 10 classes of food)\n",
    "- Build a transfer learning feature extraction model using TensorFlow Hub\n",
    "- Introduce the TensorBoard callback to track model training results\n",
    "- Compare model results using TensorBoard\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you can use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run, except for the cells which error on purpose), but there's a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write all of the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write the text descriptions but writing the code yourself is a great way to get hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you make mistakes, we all do. The way to get better and make less mistakes is to **write more code**."

Helpful to compare the results of different models on your data.\n",
    "* [**Model checkpointing**](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint) - save your model as it trains so you can stop training if needed and come back to continue off where you left. Helpful if training takes a long time and can't be done in one sitting.\n",

    "4. Remove all \"Problem domanin\" filters except for the problem you're working on. \n",

    "Since we're working with images, our target are the [models which perform best on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll probably find not all of the model architectures listed on paperswithcode appear on TensorFlow Hub. And this is okay, we can still use what's available.\n",

    "    * However, the tradeoff with larger numbers can mean they take longer to compute. \n",
    "7. Select EfficientNetB0 and you should see [something like the following](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=image-classification,image-feature-vector&network-architecture=efficientnet-b0&tf-version=tf2):\n",

    "\n",
    "三种迁移学习方式：不改变，特征抽取迁移学习（冻结原模型的大部分），微调迁移学习\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"As is\" transfer learning** is when you take a pretrained model as it is and apply it to your task without any changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example, many computer vision models are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset which contains 1000 different classes of images. This means passing a single image to this model will produce 1000 different prediction probability values (1 for each class). \n",
    "\n",
    "    * This is helpful if you have 1000 classes of image you'd like to classify and they're all the same as the ImageNet classes, however, it's not helpful if you want to classify only a small subset of classes (such as 10 different kinds of food). Model's with `\"/classification\"` in their name on TensorFlow Hub provide this kind of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction transfer learning** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) a pretrained model has learned and adjust its outputs to be more suited to your problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example, say the pretrained model you were using had 236 different layers (EfficientNetB0 has 236 layers), but the top layer outputs 1000 classes because it was pretrained on ImageNet. To adjust this to your own problem, you might remove the original activation layer and replace it with your own but with the right number of output classes. The important part here is that **only the top few layers become trainable, the rest remain frozen**. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * This way all the underlying patterns remain in the rest of the layers and you can utilise them for your own problem. This kind of transfer learning is very helpful when your data is similar to the data a model has been pretrained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning transfer learning** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) of a pretrained model and adjust (fine-tune) them to your own problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * This usually means training **some, many or all** of the layers in the pretrained model. This is useful when you've got a large dataset (e.g. 100+ images per class) where your data is slightly different to the data the original model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common workflow is to \"freeze\" all of the learned patterns in the bottom layers of a pretrained model so they're untrainable. And then train the top 2-3 layers of so the pretrained model can adjust its outputs to your custom data (**feature extraction**).\n",
    "\n",
    "常用的迁移学习方式：特征抽取迁移学习，冻结原有网络，添加两三层网络，训练\n",

Often, you'll want the larger features (learned patterns are also called features) to remain, since these are similar for both animals, where as, the differences remain in the more fine-grained features.\n",

    "1. Build and fit a model using the same data we have here but with the MobileNetV2 architecture feature extraction ([`mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/4)) from TensorFlow Hub, how does it perform compared to our other models?\n",
    "2. Name 3 different image classification models on TensorFlow Hub that we haven't used.\n",
    "3. Build a model to classify images of two different things you've taken photos of.\n",
    "  * You can use any feature extraction layer from TensorFlow Hub you like for this.\n",
    "  * You should aim to have at least 10 images of each class, for example to build a fridge versus oven classifier, you'll want 10 images of fridges and 10 images of ovens.\n",
    "4. What is the current best performing model on ImageNet?\n",
    "  * Hint: you might want to check [sotabench.com](https://www.sotabench.com) for this."

    "* Read through the [TensorFlow Transfer Learning Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) and define the main two types of transfer learning in your own words.\n",
    "* Go through the [Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Hub tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub) on the TensorFlow website and rewrite all of the code yourself into a new Google Colab notebook making comments about what each step does along the way.\n",
    "* We haven't covered fine-tuning with TensorFlow Hub in this notebook, but if you'd like to know more, go through the [fine-tuning a TensorFlow Hub model tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) on the TensorFlow homepage.How to fine-tune a tensorflow hub model:  \n",
    "* Look into [experiment tracking with Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/experiment-tracking), how could you integrate it with our existing TensorBoard logs?"
